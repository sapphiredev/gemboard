## About

Gemboard is a private starboard bot for Sapphire. We love starboard functionality but we've found any public bots lacking. They always have one issue or another, so we decided to make our own.

## Buy us some doughnuts

Sapphire Community is and always will be open source, even if we don't get donations. That being said, we know there are amazing people who may still want to donate just to show their appreciation. Thank you very much in advance!

We accept donations through Open Collective, Ko-fi, Paypal, Patreon and GitHub Sponsorships. You can use the buttons below to donate through your method of choice.
